<tr><td>Ensemble</td><td>3 Male, 3 Female</td><td>18+</td>
		<td>
			The ensemble of this show must be quadruple threats, as they portray every other character in this show.

			strong actors who are able to play multiple small but EXTREMELY important character roles,
			and they must possess the ability to roller skate (or be willing to learn).
			All additional characters are played by this very busy ensemble.
