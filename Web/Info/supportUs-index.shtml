				<h3>SEE A SHOW</h3>
				<p>
					After all, it's what we do. The <strong>PINOLE COMMUNITY PLAYERS</strong> exists because of our audiences,
					the people who pay to see our productions, who come to our Playhouse to be entertained.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ticket revenue doesn't cover the cost of a show, but full houses help.
				</p>
				<h3>TELL YOUR FRIENDS</h3>
				<p>
					Word of mouth is a very effective way to fill our seats.
					If you enjoyed a show, maybe some friends or family members will.
					How about arranging a night out at the theatre with friends.
				</p>
				<h5>If your group is 15 or more, you can save with our Group Rate.</h5>
				<p style="font-size:smaller!important; max-width:600px;; margin:0px auto">
					For groups of 15 or more, tickets are $18 each for musicals, $13 each for non-musicals.<br />
					Please leave your name and phone number on the Box Office Line at 510-724-9844
					and our Ticket Coordinator will return your call to take your group order.
				</p>
				<h3>COME TO THE CABARET</h3>
				<p>
					Our annual dinner show and silent auction is a fun social event that is also our largest fund raiser of the year.
				</p>
				<h2 style="text-align:center;">GOING THE EXTRA MILE</h2>
				<p>
					Call <span style="font-size:larger; font-weight:bold;">510&#8209;724&#8209;9844</span>
					to find out about these ways to help keep live theatre alive in Pinole.
				</p>
				<h3>BECOME A PATRON</h3>
				<p>
					Have you ever thought you could be a <a href=/2016SponsorshipForm.shtml class="horizontalPanelTextColor">Patron of the Arts</a>?
					Here are the <a href=/Info/ourPatrons-index.shtml class="horizontalPanelTextColor">fine people</a> who have most recently donated to <strong>PCP</strong>.
				</p>
				<p>
				<h3>ADVERTISE IN OUR SHOW PROGRAMS</h3>
				<p>
					Promote your business by purchasing an advertisement in our full color program.
					Your ad can reach more than 750 audience members with each production and will run for the full year.
				</p>
				<h3>UNDERWRITE A PRODUCTION</h3>
				<p>
					Let your company's or family's generosity shine as an underwriter of one of our productions.
				</p>
				<h3>TAKE A PHOTO!</h3>
				<p>
					Sponsor a Cast Photo in our Lobby.
					Each large 20x24-inch photo has an engraved tag identifying you as sponsor.
				</p>
				<h3>VOLUNTEER</h3>
				<p>
					<strong>PCP</strong> exists because of the work of hundreds of people.
				</p>
				<p>
					They don't do it for money - there isn't any left after we finance our productions.
					They do it for love - most for love of theatre, some for love of community, some for love of family.
				</p>
				<p>
					They come from every walk of life - adults, teenagers, even children.
					They become carpenters, seamstresses, actors, musicians, janitors, stage hands, technicians,
					stage managers, directors, concessionaires, ticket sellers, ushers, all of the roles required to run
					a theatre company, produce a show, present a show.
				</p>
