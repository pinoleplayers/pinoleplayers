					We are working to minimize the amount of printed materials we produce, and eliminate postal mailings, as much as possible.
					
					This will save on paper, printing, and postage, and reduce our consumption of natural resources.
					
					We want to move most of our communications to the internet for the 2015-16 season and beyond.
					
					We already have this website, a Facebook page, and an e-mail list.
					
					We hope that we can get as many of you as possible on the e-mail list.
					
					You will receive season, show, and fund-raiser announcements in your e-mail box.
					
					We then will ask you if we can remove you from our postal mailing list.
					
					Our mailing list is managed by an outside vendor, Constant Contact, whose business and reputation depend on protecting your information.
					
					You can read their privacy policy
