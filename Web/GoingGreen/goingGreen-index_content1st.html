In an effort to be more efficient with your donations, we are making the push to have most of our communications be electronic by our 2015-16 season.
We want to use our e-mail list to
announce shows and other great events
remind you to grab seats before we sell out






We hope that we can get as many of you as possible on the e-mail list.

We will use our e-mail list to:

announce our season, 
announce our productions,


We're Going Green

We are working to minimize the amount of printed materials we produce, and eliminate, as much as possible, postal mailings.

This will save on paper, printing, and postage, and reduce our consumption of natural resources.

We want to move most of our communications to the internet for the 2015-16 season and beyond.

We already have this website, a Facebook page, and an e-mail list.

We hope that we can get as many of you as possible on the e-mail list.

You will receive season, show, and fund-raiser announcements in your e-mail box.

We then will ask you if we can remove you from our postal mailing list.

Our mailing list is managed by an outside vendor, Constant Contact, whose business and reputation depend on protecting your information.

You can read their privacy policy here. http://ui.constantcontact.com/roving/CCPrivacyPolicy.jsp
