<p><b>Mike Talman</b>  <b>M/35-50</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time a decent human being (and still with impulses that lean in this direction),
Mike is a small time grifter who has fallen in the wrong crowd.
Recently released from prison, Mike is alone in the world and in serious debt.
Afraid for his life, he teams up with Roat and his sinister plan.
He develops a fondness for Susy that is evident.
</p>

<tr><td  colspan=2>
<p><b>Sergeant Carlino, M/40-55</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlino is a small time crook.
He is coarse, uneducated and is mostly lacking in conscience.
He is not cruel or sadistic, but has no trouble doing what needs to be done in order to survive.
He is a fairly good con man, though certainly not the brains behind any scheme.
He and Mike Talman are fairly good friends, and have worked together previously.
He is also a parolee and is broke. He doesn't like or trust Roat, the the opportunity for a big score is too good to pass up.

<tr><td  colspan=2>
<p><b>Harry Roat, M/30-50</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A true sociopath, Roat has no empathy for anyone, and a sadistic streak a mile wide.
He is highly intelligent and manipulates people with ease.
He is an excellent con man, though unlike Talman and Carlino, that is not his only game.
He is a versatile and audacious criminal and will do anything for money or thrills.
He enjoys seeing others in pain and has no conscience whatsoever.
He is a master of disguise and more athletic than he may appear.
He is narcissistic and believes that other people are far beneath him.
He will stop at nothing to achieve his goals. Interestingly, when the tables are turned on him, he can be quite cowardly and small.

<p><b>Susy Hendrix, F/28-33</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Susy is a vivacious young woman recently blinded in a car accident.
She is strong willed and determined no to let her disability ruin her life.
She met Sam a few months after the accident and was drawn to his refusal to see her as handicapped.
Sam's unsentimental way of dealing with her blindness gives her strength and she loves him for it.
She does have her bad days.
She is highly sensitive and intuitive.
These traits may make her seem vulnerable but her spirit is strong.
She can be irritable with Sam and often with Gloria, and even though she tries, she can let all of this get here down from time to time.
Susy is still adjusting to her blindness and her recent marriage.
She loves Sam and knows they are a good match and is optimistic about their future.
Faced with the life-or-death threat posed by the three con men, she discovers a strength, self-sufficiency and resourcefulness she didn't know she had.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td  colspan=2>
<p><b>Sam Hendrix, M/35-40</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam is a former marine.
He is tough and intelligent but not an intellectual.
He is practical and is content with the life he has created for himself.
He does not wallow in sentiment, and though he does have a sensitive side, he has difficulty showing it to others, even Susy.
He does not second-guess himself or wonder about the road not taken.
He works hard and enjoys life with Susy.
He loves her very much and wants to see her reach her full potential as a person regardless of her disability.
He is impressed with Susy's strong spirit but is also attracted to her vulnerability and how unaware of that vulnerability she seems to be.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td  colspan=2>
<p><b>Gloria, F/12-15</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gloria is at that awkward age between childhood and adolescence.
She is bright and has a good heart.
Her home life is fairly tough, with an undependable mother and a father who recently abandoned them both.
She is terribly uncomfortable in her changing body.
She wants to be seen as a young woman but still has many childish tendencies.
She has a crush on Sam and is jealous of Susy, whom she blames for coming between herself and Sam.
As a result, her relationship with Susy is often volatile.
Deep down, she is very fond of Susy and sees her as a surrogate mother/big sister.
By the end of the play, having seen Susy go through such a harrowing ordeal, Gloria discovers a new respect for Susy.
