											<h2>Our History</h2>
											<p>In 1986, two <a href="http://www.ci.pinole.ca.us/" target="_blank">Pinole (California)</a>
													couples, Gary &amp; Nancy Gill and David &amp; Patti Clark met around the  Gill's kitchen
													table to discuss their dream of forming a local community theatre group.
													Utilizing Gary's technical knowledge, Nancy's musical talents, David's directing background
													and Patti's producing and organizational skills, the <strong>PINOLE COMMUNITY  PLAYERS</strong>
													were born.
													Contact was made with Father Tom Ryan at&nbsp; St. Joseph's Church to seek support for the
													new endeavor.
													With Father  Ryan's blessing and financial support, and the use of the school auditorium,
													<em>GODSPELL</em>, the first production of the new theatrical company, was  born.
													Tryout's were conducted and an outstanding cast of young local people hit the newly
													constructed stage in July of 1986.
													Two more successful seasons followed with the  productions of<em> OLIVER, THE FANTASTICKS</em>
													and <em>SOUTH PACIFIC</em>, but in 1989 the St. Joseph's auditorium was no longer available
													and it became necessary to find a new venue for the Pinole Community Players.
											</p>
											<p>At this point, the City of Pinole offered the use of the Pinole Memorial Center.
													Able to pack up lights, scenery and costumes at a moments notice, the Pinole Players became
													a band of traveling performers in  the true theatrical tradition.
													<em>COMPANY,  A CHORUS LINE, BABY, ANNIE, </em><em>A LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS</em> and
													<em>GUYS &amp; DOLLS</em> brought PCP to their 1991-92 SEASON &ndash; but still homeless.
													But by now, the Pinole Community Players consisted of many talented local people, including
													entire families -- all bitten by the theatrical bug -- who worked  diligently and tirelessly
													to make PCP a well-respected performance  group.
													In 1990, the Board of Directors approached the Pinole City Council with the possibility of
													leasing the Pinole Memorial Center  as the Players' permanent performance space.
											</p>
											<p>By the summer of 1991, the City Council voted unanimously in favor of this agreement, pledged
												their support to the group and granted  permission to establish the PINOLE COMMUNITY PLAYHOUSE.
												<em>THE BEST OF  BROADWAY</em> opened the 1991-92 season and plans were underway to make
												renovations to the building and expand the number of  adult and children's performances each year.
												This group has been able to accomplish renovations to the building, an increase in audience
												attendance, introduction of new directors and new <a href="pastProductions.shtml" target="_parent">
												productions</a>.
												Pinole Community Players' quality productions, intimate performance space, unique cabaret style
												and family atmosphere continue to be strengths as the second decade  begins.
											</p>
											<p>Voted &quot;Best in the West&quot; by West County Times readers and supported by civic leaders,
												theatre goers, and the community in  general.
