											<h2>Our History</h2>
											<p>In 1986, two <a href="http://www.ci.pinole.ca.us/" target="_blank">Pinole (California)</a>
												couples, Gary &amp; Nancy Gill and David &amp; Patti Clark met around the  Gill's kitchen
												table to discuss their dream of forming a local community theatre group.
												Utilizing Gary's technical knowledge, Nancy's musical talents, David's directing background
												and Patti's producing and organizational skills, the <strong>PINOLE COMMUNITY PLAYERS</strong>
												was born.
											</p>
											<p>
												Contact was made with Father Tom Ryan, pastor of Pinole's St. Joseph Catholic Church, seeking
												support for the new endeavor.
												With Father Ryan's blessing and financial support, the Players gained use of the St. Joseph School auditorium.
												This required the Players to &quot;load in&quot; the production two weeks before opening --
												constructing a stage, hanging lights, setting up dressing rooms, bringing in tables and chairs --
												and &quot;load out&quot; when the show closed.

											<p>
												<em>GODSPELL</em>, a musical based on the Gospel of St. Matthew, was the first production of the new
												theatrical company.
												Auditions were conducted and an outstanding cast of young local people hit the newly
												constructed stage in July of 1986.
												Two more successful seasons followed with the productions of <em>OLIVER</em>, <em>THE FANTASTICKS</em>
												and <em>SOUTH PACIFIC</em>.

											</a>
											<p>In 1989 the St. Joseph's auditorium was no longer available
												and it became necessary to find a new venue for the Pinole Community Players.
												Learning of the need for a performing space, the City of Pinole offered the use of the Pinole Memorial Center,
												which at that time housed the Pinole Senior Center.
												Able to pack up lights, scenery and costumes at a moment's notice, the Pinole Players became
												a band of traveling performers in the true theatrical tradition.
											</p>
											<p>
												<em>COMPANY</em>, <em>A CHORUS LINE</em>, <em>BABY</em>, <em>ANNIE</em>, <em>A LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS</em> and
												<em>GUYS &amp; DOLLS</em> brought PCP to their 1991-92 SEASON.
												The Pinole Community Players had grown with the addition of many talented local people, including
												entire families -- all bitten by the theatrical bug -- who worked  diligently and tirelessly
												to make PCP a well-respected performance  group.
											</p>
											<p>
												Still lacking a permanent home, in 1990, the Board of Directors approached the Pinole City Council with a
												proposal to lease the Pinole Memorial Center as the Players' permanent performance space.
												In the summer of 1991, the City Council voted unanimously in favor of this agreement, pledged
												their support to the group and granted permission to establish the PINOLE COMMUNITY PLAYHOUSE.

											<p>
												<em>THE BEST OF  BROADWAY</em> opened the 1991-92 season and plans were underway to make
												renovations to the building and expand the number of  adult and children's performances each year.
												This group has been able to accomplish renovations to the building, an increase in audience
												attendance, introduction of new directors and new <a href="pastProductions.shtml" target="_parent">
												productions</a>.
												Pinole Community Players' quality productions, intimate performance space, unique cabaret style
												and family atmosphere continue to be strengths as its second quarter century begins.
											</p>
											<p>Voted &quot;Best in the West&quot; by West County Times readers and supported by civic leaders,
												theatre goers, and the community in general.
