<h4>MALES</h4>
</td></tr>
<tr  colspan=3><td  colspan=3>
<p><b>Jerry Lukowski</b> - Tenor - (Triple threat....actor, singer, dancer....the lead.) Unemployed mill worker; was the foreman at the steel mill in Buffalo, NY, 32, or somewhat older. (Actor must be old enough that we believe he is the father of a 12 year old) He is divorced from Pam and in debt. He&rsquo;ll lose custody of his son Nathan if he can&rsquo;t make his $700 monthly payment. He is a proud, blue-collar guy; loves his beer and hanging out with the guys. He is handsome, tough and cocky, partly due to his insecurities over being out of work. He is somewhat athletic with a good sense of humor. The ladies comment that he has a great ass. He loves his son more than anything. Best friend to Dave. We&rsquo;re pulling for Jerry.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr  colspan=3><td  colspan=3>
<p><b>Dave</b> - Tenor - (Triple threat, singer, actor, dancer. Actor must be overweight and also comfortable to appear on stage in his underwear. A big stomach is an asset. Great comic timing. Second male lead.) 30&rsquo;s or 40&rsquo;s, he is an unemployed Buffalo mill worker and Jerry&rsquo;s best friend. Tender hearted guy with an inferiority complex about his weight and also his state of unemployment. Good person we feel for and identify with. His wife is employed, and he&rsquo;s home doing housework. Things aren&rsquo;t good in the bedroom due his esteem issues. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr  colspan=3><td  colspan=3>
<p><b>Malcolm</b> - Tenor - (singer, actor, dancer) Late 20&rsquo;s, 30&rsquo;s. or early 40&rsquo;s. Beautiful tenor voice. Still lives with his sickly wheelchair bound mother. He&rsquo;s an unemployed mill worker. Now works as the night security guard since the plant has closed. He&rsquo;s a sensitive guy. He longs for a place of his own someday. He&rsquo;s lonely and has no friends until Jerry and Dave save him from suicide in one of the funniest numbers in the show "Big Ass Rock".</p>
</td></tr>
<tr  colspan=3><td  colspan=3>
<p><b>Harold</b> - Baritone- (singer, actor, dancer) 40&rsquo;s or 50&rsquo;s. Good dance partner with his wife Vicki who runs a dance studio for couples. He worships Vicki, but continues to lie to her, not telling her he was laid off at the mill. Jerry and Dave bring him into the Monty six to help assemble a group and to teach them all HOW to dance for the one night only Monty event. He is older and more authoritative than Jerry, Dave, and Malcolm. He is somewhat of a stuffed shirt cynic. Has an MBA from Wharton School of Business. Has higher standard of living with even bigger debts to pay, which is motivation to become a part of the Monty event. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr  colspan=3><td  colspan=3>
<p><b>Ethan</b> - Baritone/Tenor- (actor, mover, singer) Late 20&rsquo;s or 30&rsquo;s. He can pull of the physical stunt of running across stage several times throughout show, trying to recreate Donald O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s run up the wall trick in SINGING IN THE RAIN, his favorite movie. He is handsome, energetic and eager to please. He moons the audience in Act I during a very funny scene when he&rsquo;s auditioning to be one of the Monty six.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr  colspan=3><td  colspan=3>
<p><b>Horse</b> - Baritone/Tenor- (actor, mover, singer) Appears to be 50&rsquo;s or 60ish or younger actor who can pass for older with the help of special effects. He is African-American. He connects more with Jeanette, the older piano player. He enters frail. Not cheerful; funny curmudgeon traits, yet comes alive in his number "Big Black Man" with some great funky chicken moves. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr  colspan=3><td  colspan=3>
<p><b>Keno</b> - (actor, dancer) from 20&rsquo;s to 40. He has a great acting scene with Jerry and Dave in the first part of the show. Some good laugh lines. Has a great body; a showman; comfortable and athletic with stripping to g-string in big number at the top of the show; has an edge of gay confidence and practicality; knows who he is and quite comfortable with it; takes no crap from Jerry; also has a boyfriend; been in the business for some time and takes it seriously; a successful Chippendale that hasn&rsquo;t been negatively affected by the recession; we like this guy. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr  colspan=3><td  colspan=3>
<p><b>Nathan</b> - (actor) 12- 14 years old (or looks like he&rsquo;s 12) He very much loves his dad Jerry, who gets visitation rights on weekends. Jerry uses the "f" word around Nathan, who is a savvy kid for 12. Nathan uses it once as well. Sometimes it appears Nathan may be more mature than his dad actually, as he bounces between both parents as he seems to be the grounding force in Jerry&rsquo;s life. He likes soccer, hockey, and other sports. He jogs with his dad in the park. He is level headed and wise for his age. A terrific acting role for a young man, however the role requires someone who is mature enough to handle the language and content of this play, who is also comfortable around a lot of adults. The actor&rsquo;s parents must also be on board as part of the support team in providing this opportunity for the young man.. The very real father/son relationship drives the plot of the whole story and their interaction presents some of the most satisfying and touching moments in the play. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr  colspan=3><td  colspan=3>
<p><b>Teddy</b> - (actor) 30&rsquo;s or early 40&rsquo;s He is a handsome guy who is Pam&rsquo;s live-in boyfriend. She hasn&rsquo;t said yes to marry him yet. He is everything he is not, starting with his finances. He has a job in which he wears a suit and tie to work, does yoga classes with Pam, buys hockey tickets for him and Nathan, and plans a vacation with Pam to Cape Cod. He can provide stability for Pam and Nathan that Jerry cannot. </p>
