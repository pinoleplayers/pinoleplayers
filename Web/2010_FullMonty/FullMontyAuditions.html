<h3><i>The Full Monty</i> Synopsis</h3>
<p>Seeing how much their wives enjoy watching male strippers during their "Girls' Night Out," unemployed steelworkers 
in Buffalo New York come up with a bold way to make some quick cash. In the process they find renewed self-esteem, 
the importance of friendship and the ability to have fun.</p>
<p>As the guys work through their fears, self-consciousness, feelings of worthlessness and anxieties (over everything 
from being overweight to child custody, bigotry to being gay), they come to discover that not only are they stronger 
as a group, but that the strength they find in each other gives them the individual courage to face their demons and 
overcome them.</p>
<p>There is great heart to <i>THE FULL MONTY</i>, and the ultimate themes expressed in the show, about taking charge of one&rsquo;s 
life, following one?s dreams and stripping the barriers that prevent one from succeeding.</p>
<p>The MONTY WOMEN are just as important to the theme as the men.  As well as men who can sing, dance and work well as 
a team, the director is also looking for strong, sassy, sexy gals (no matter what your size or shape). They are the 
spring board (and back-story) for everything their men are doing.</p>

<h3>Vocal Audition Tips</h3>
<p><strong>For all:</strong> Please prepare 32 bars from a show with a similar rock style.</p>
<p>Accompanist provided/tapes ok.</p>  
<p><strong>For all women:</strong> Almost all female roles in this show will need to &quot;belt&quot;, or just sing loud 
much of the time. So if possible, prepare an audition song that shows off your &quot;belt&quot; or at least your ability 
to sing with volume.<p>
<p>For men trying out for the roles of Jerry, Dave, or Malcolm: These parts are all written very high in the male 
register, so try to prepare an audition song that shows off your highest range.</p>

<h3>Audition Notes</h3>
<p>Please bring your calendar so you can check for rehearsal conflicts.</p>
<p>Sides will be provided for call backs.</p>
<p><strong>Actors auditioning for non-singing roles should prepare one two-minute comedic monologue.</strong></p>
