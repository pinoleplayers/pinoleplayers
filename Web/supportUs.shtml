																The <strong>PINOLE COMMUNITY PLAYERS</strong> exists because of our audiences,
																the people who pay to see our productions,
																the people of Pinole and surrounding cities,
																who come to our Playhouse to be entertained.
															</p>
															<p>
																The money they pay for tickets and for concessions pays the fees we pay for the
																rights to produce the shows.
																It buys the lumber to build the sets and the paint.
																It rents special costumes or props that we don't have in our collection and
																can't borrow from other theatre groups.
																It pays to copy the programs, buy the concessions, buy the special bulbs for the
																theatre lighting.
															</p>
															<p>
																Sometimes ticket revenue doesn't cover the costs of our shows.
															</p>
															<p>
																<strong>PCP</strong> exists because of the monetary support of a few special people
																over the years.
																Some have given tens of dollars, some hundreds of dollars, and a few have given thousands
																of dollars.
																Here are the <a href=ourPatrons.shtml>people<a></a> who have most recently donated to <strong>PCP</strong>.
																If you have the means, perhaps you would like to become a <a href=2010-2011SponsorshipForm.shtml>
																Patrons of the Arts</a>.
															</p>
															<p>
																<strong>PCP</strong> exists because of the work of hundreds of people.
															</p>
															<p>
																Some have worked tens of hours, some hundreds of hours, and some thousands of hours.
																A few have worked on every show, many on many shows, some on only one.
															</p>
															<p>
																They don't do it for the money - there isn't any left over after we finance our productions.
																They do it for love - most for love of theatre, some for love of community, some for love of family.
															</p>
															<p>
																They come from every walk of life - adults, teenagers, even children.
																They become carpenters, seamstresses, actors, musicians, maintenance workers, stage hands, technicians,
																managers, directors, concessionaires, ticket sellers, ticket takers, all of the roles required to run
																a theatre company, produce a show, present a show.
															</p>
															<p>Perhaps you are one of those amazing people</p>
